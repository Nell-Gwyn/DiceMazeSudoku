A puzzle I put together for CTC's monthly puzzle prompt.

todo (currently working on):
• Finish the "About" tab, which will further explain what the heck this thing is and why it's for the monthly puzzle prompt
• Add a second set of undo/redo buttons/commands, this one for dice moves
• Make center/corner digits more legible
• Add a screenshot feature

todo (low priority):
• Allow multicoloring cells when highlighting
• Make an editor (if, for whatever bizarre reason, there's interest in making more of these things)
